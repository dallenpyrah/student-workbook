# Week 6 Journal 3 

- What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

Lifecyle hooks are window into how our library works behind the scenes. It allows us to see a lot of aspects that are happening in our application for example we can see when things have been created, deleted, updated or added to the DOM.

- How have you utilized lifcycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

We have used the lifecyle hooks in almost all of our afternoon projects this week. We have created, deleted, updated, and added dynamically to the DOM. We have been able to see how vue has deep event listeners making it much easier for us to know what is going on and easier in the aspect that we don't have to write them. For example we have use the onmounted hook, and that is when we call that page to our screen it will automatically render. 

- What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

Mounting hooks allow us to access our componenets immediately before and after we first render them. It is often the most used life cycle hook, we use mounted when we want to access the components before or after our first render of them. beforemount we might use before we create something so that we can see the data we are passing through.
