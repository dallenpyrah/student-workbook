# Week 6 Journal 2

- What are props?

Props are how we pass variables and other information around between different components. Its similiar to how we can pass variable into functions as arguements. We pass props to another component and that component can now use that value. 

- What are props used for?

Props are used to pass values to different components so that they are able to use that information. It allows use to have dynamic applications and reusable code which makes our life a whole lot easier. We use props to pass down information to our children or pass down the tree so that they can use it. 

- Where can props be used or accessed?

Props can be used/accessed only once we declare them in our component definition. Its best practice to specify the type of prop as well using an object which gives it more of a clear view. This sets clear expectations for what we will recieve.
