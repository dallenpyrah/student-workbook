- What is Component based architecture?

A method for encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface into self sustaining micro systems. A component is a small feautre the makes up part of the user interface. Comparing component based architecture to the old javascript design pattern were using makes vanilla javascript look outdated. 

- What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

Each component is seperate from each other allowing for concerns to be isolated to that specific component. Each one can update independently without any reliabilty on the others in order to work. This allows us to have multiple components on one page without any dependency on the other. Facebook utilizes this heavily making their webpage robust. One of the most important parts that makes components crazy effective is that they are reusable and can be used multiple times throughout our application. 

- What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

Some drawbacks to component based architecture is that everything that once was seperated in their own files for their own purpose are now in the same file making the readability of our files degraded. Another drawback is that some developers over use this framework and depend so heavily on it that their application is over egineered when it should be a helper in our journey to produce our application.
