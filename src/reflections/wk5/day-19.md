- What is the purpose of a Query String?

The query strings purpose is to add information to and from a webiste by appending that information to the end of a url. Its stored in the query string and captured by the website. When we are using API's this allows us to access very specific properties in order to get the data back that we want. 

- What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

The format of a query parameter at its base looks like key=value, when we are calling them on our URL's it will looke like hamburger.com/api/hamburgers?a=1, A is the key and 1 is the value. Now if we want to distinguish between one query parameter and the next it will look like key=value&key2=value2 the & symbol signals that the first query parameter is not the same as the second therefore seperating them. 

- When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

I think that Query parameters will be helpful when writing our servers when we want to narrow down the criteria that we are searching for or the data that we want to get back. We can get very specific information back rather than the whole object, or database.
