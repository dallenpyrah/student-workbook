What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming is when two or more developers get together and work on a project. In our case we have 2-3 people and we are all working on one computer or order to learn the most from each other. The roles are one person codes and the other two people help by offering solutions. Then the roles switch every two hours so that everyone has their hands on the project. 

What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

Some benefits of pair programming are that we are able to work on a bigger project because we have more than one mind trying to tackle the problem. Another benefit is that we are able to learn from each other because there are some things that each person hasn't learned but the other person may be knowledgable in. This allows us to grow into better developers. 

What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

Some drawbacks of pair programming is that sometimes you may not like the person you are working with or you may not work well with them and its really hard to communicate with them. This leads to the project being a mess because neither person really knows what the other person wants. Another drawback of pair programming is that you are really only working on one computer and code isnt getting wrote twice as fast.
