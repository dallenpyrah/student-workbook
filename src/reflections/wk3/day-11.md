# Week 3 Journal 1

1. What problem does using exports solve?

Before E6 came around developers had to put multiple script tags within the HTML document in order to have different files and this affected the performance of webpages. With E6 modules we can import and export multiple javascript files from one main javascript document. This helps with peformance and being able to import information from different javscript files without having to rewrite each and every function.

2. How does export differ from export default?

Using just export allows us to export multiple named exports per file while port defualt only allows us to do one at a time. If we want to export different more than one the best way to do this is to use just export otherwise if we are only exporting one name, we will use export defualt. 

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

A benefit of using the module system is code can be split into smaller files that have specific purposes. Rather than having millions of lines of code all in one document we can make it more organized now and spilt it between documents allowing developers to have an easier time reading what the code is doing and less mistakes.
