# Week 3 Journal 4

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

The observer pattern helps us in many ways one of the ways it helps us is when we need to update the page in multiple areas with one user input. It helps us build resuable code that will help us solve our specific problems.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

It provides us methods to register and remove the observer, helps us maintain a list of its observeres/subscribers, and then notify them automatically when any state changes. 

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

The proxystate, observer pattern, and the bcw-template helps us out when we want to dynamically change the page when any type of change happens to our data. When any part of the code changes due to user input with the observer pattern, it makes it so the page changes in real time. This is ideal because it keeps our applications running smooth.
