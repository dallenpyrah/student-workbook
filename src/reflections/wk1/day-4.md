# Week 1 Journal 4

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

The purpose of wire-framing is to get a great proto-type of a concept website before we go and try to code it with no visual aide.
Often times we can lose time trying to start up a website and code it without a proto-type design because we are trying to think of a design for the website and code the website at the same time. When having these mockups we can look at the design we made through wire framing and try to replicate it through code without trying to come up with a design at the same time making life a whoe lot easier. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There are three levels of wire-frames starting at the bottom with low-fidelity wire frames. The are about as basic as it gets as far as the detial goes between the three of these levels. What a low-fidelity wire frame can do for us is help us layout what we would want the page to look like foundational wise. The second level is the most common with mid-fidelity wire frames, this allows us to create a mock design of a website and go more into the detial of it unlike the lower level. A mid-fidelity wire frame would most likely be created in an application like Figma which is what we used today. This allows us to get the dimesions of the screen correct and also create multiple page layouts that makes it easy to carry similiar elements page to page. Once we get to a high-fidelity wire frame we start adding in the fine detials of the webpage we are building. For example rounding the edges on a card, or changing the colors within that card so that they are contrasting creating a look that pops out of the page. 

The best way to think about all of these are low-fidelty wire frames are something the can be sketched out, mid-fidelty wire frames are an outline of where everything would be, and high-fidelty wire frames are when we go in an finish out all the fine detials offering a stunning and polished website proto-type. 

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

100% I think that wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy and Effort. If we think about it like any design process we have to start with a rough draft and why not let that be the wire frame. It is a great starting place for any designer/developer to put their ideas into action making it a quick and effective way before starting any of the coding. Then when we get done with wire frame, we have a visual representation of what we want our website to look like. It's splitting the job into sections rather than trying to take it all on at once. Worry about the design aspect and once thats done we can worry about how we are going to code it to look like that.
