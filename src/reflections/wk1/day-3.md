# Week 1 Journal 3

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

My favorite tip for improving the design of my websites has got to be using a box shadow for some elements. I like the way that it looks on the page, rather than having a rigid design with a border surrounding it the box shadow gives it a smoother effect making the webpage look more fluid. I also have to add that I liked the idea of rather than changing the size of text to emphasis heirarchy, change the color, font-weight, or style of the text to emphasis elements. It visually makes the pages look a whole lot better without actually changing the size of the elements. 

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

Cheating at design is a create resource to start with that will give us a solid foundation, I do believe that there are some other websites that we can utilize in order to create a more stunning website as well. I've already started pinterest boards with designs that I think are examples of good designs since I created my own clothing company website. Another resource I will utilize is  Awwwards.com they have some really modern and up to the times designs that will help me completly reinvent how I think about web design.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Good design helps a lot because a lot of times its the first impression on the vistor to your website. That's something that I notice right away, when a website has fluid and responsive layout i'm more inclined to trust their product because they took time to make their design stellar. Maybe thats because I love the design aspects of all things in my life, but I truly believe this matters for other people. With great design we can convey that we are a trusted brand, company, or website.
