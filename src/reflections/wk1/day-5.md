# Week one Journal 5

This week we learned a lot of new stuff in a short amount of time, I thought it was going to be hard to handle so much information at one time but when we put the information we learn in lectures to use in projects those concepts get concreted into my mind. It's a great way to learn something rather than having a bunch of information I have to memorize in order to pass a test. That's what I was hoping to happen when I came to this school, I really wanted to learn about coding not just memorize terms. So far they've done a great job at that which I appreciate. Building these real world projects I believe will get me ready to becoem a software developer faster than anything else could. The only thing I was struggling with this week was nested rows, but the more I studied it and applied it in projects I understood them better and by the time Friday came around all my questions around them were answered.
