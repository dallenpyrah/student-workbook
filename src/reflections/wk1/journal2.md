## Journal two

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A Pseudo-Class can change an element on a page using CSS to behave a different way. For example, when we use the :hover psuedo class on a button (button:hover) we will be able to move our pointer mouse over the button and we can change the color of the button or different elements when we are "hovering" over the button. It's hard to say right now which one I will use most but starting out I will definently use the :hover Pseudo class because I like the functionality of it allowing users to be able to know whether or not their mouse is on the button. It's like giving them visual confirmation that if they press the button the desired task will be excueted. I also liked the games we played this morning with CSS, learning about the Psuedo classes was helpful and learning about the ability to select different elements without affecting other ones of the same type but not class was helpful. 

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is the importance given to a certian tag, class, or Id. Tags by themselves have a specificity of 1, classes have a specificity of 10, and Id's have a specificity of 100. One way that will hurt me in the long wrong is using the style element in my html sheet in order to style a certian tag like h1 because of its high specificity of 1000 it will be very hard to overide. The way that I can use it to my benefit is by starting out with a low specificity and target tags like <div> or <body> for example so that later on I can add a class to the tags and overide it without ever changing the CSS rules for those tags. 

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

 Over utilization of the !important feature could lead to a sticky situation later on down the development process. It is basically saying to the computer that nothing should overide this, it is the superior term in the specificity line up. Now if I were to use it on different aspects in my style sheet, I wouldn't be able to overide it with any other combination of tags and classes put together so it would be incredibly hard and may not be possible to change it unless I removed the !important feature. It's why I plan on steering away from ever using this unless it's absolutely necassary in order for my application to work properly.
