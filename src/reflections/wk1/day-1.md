# Week 1 Journal 1


Hello! My name is Dallen Pyrah, I'm 20 years old and i've lived in Boise my whole life. 
Some things that I enjoy doing during my free time involve skateboarding, swimming, working out, or to simplify it anything that involves being physically active. I decided in the summer of 2020 that I wanted to get into software engineering and started looking at some options. I was in college at the time so I decided I would pursue a degree in computer science, but I really wanted to get into the field quicker. Thats when I came across codeworks, someone had recommeded I looked into it and came to the conclusion that I wanted to go through the course. I'm excited to begin this journey and can't wait to see where it leads me in life!
