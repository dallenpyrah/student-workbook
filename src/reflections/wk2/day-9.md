# Week 2 Journal 9

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

The benefits of making a plan is to write down everything we want our code to do before going in and coding because it gives us a guide and reference on what wer are trying to do. If we go into coding without a clear plan on what we want we will have to think what to write in the funticions and how to write it. Rather than just focusing on everything at once the best way is to break it into pieces so that we take on each small challenge at a time. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

There are multiple ways to find answers to our problems, if we have been stuck for a significant amount of time we should first try googling to find a solution to our problem. Most of the time when you run into a problem someone else has too and unless you're creating software no one else in the world has ever tryed most of the time you'll be able to find the answer online. If that doesn't work reach out to some of your other softare developer friends and co-workers to see if they can help you with your problem. Most of the time if you don't know it someone else out there has the skill set to find the solution. Different minds think it a variety of different ways. 

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

The article was a great read, I think that learning from someone elses mistakes can often be the most helpfull way to grow faster because we won't have to go through those same mistakes. Now there will still be times where our stubborness may lead us into making those same mistakes but at least we know where we wen't wrong. The biggest takeaways for me, were looking something up or asking for help rather than sitting trying to solve the same problem by yourself for hours. I need to get better at asking for help, but I am glad because it helps me grow in my career and my life. Another take away was taking breaks, I know during our morning lectures they have us take 10 min breaks but I am use to working in a fast food restraunt and most of the time we would only have one 30 min break a day. With coding our brain is trying to solve complex problems and if we are always trying to force it to do something without giving it a little break we will struggle to find the solution.
