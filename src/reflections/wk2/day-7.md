# Week 2 Journal 7

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

The first way to create a function for example looks like Function DrawScoreboard(){} this is the most common occurence and can harbor almost everything that we want to do within a function. The second function is an anonymous function which looks like let name = function(parameter) this sets the anonymous function equal to a variable where we can use later on in our document. The third way to write a function is using the arrow exxpression which is best used for if we want to create shorter syntax functions.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are what we use to define a function and are put in these brackets (), this gives a function some parameters for running. Arguments are the value that the function recieves from each and every one of those parameters whenever we call it throughout our javascript file. A good way to think about it is the parameters are the conditions and the arguments are the results from those conditons. 

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

A higher order function is a function that recieves a function as an arguement or a function as the output. 
We wen't over a higher order function in class today without even metioning it as one. We used the splice, sort, and join methods in order to sort through an array, and join them in a new array so that they would all be in order alphabetically. A higher order function is a great when we are dealing with complex problems and allow us to do things more effectively than a regular function.
