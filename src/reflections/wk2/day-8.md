# Week 2 Journal 8
1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

The main way to write information to the console is by using console.log() this method allows us to pass through any data type, or any functon and it will log whatever we want that function to do into the dev tools console window. This allows us to see how our function is working if at all and then adjust when needed. We will use console.log in most situations but there are some situations where we might use something like console.warn() which works the same way as console.log() but is more so using it to warn us that something could potentionally break if we keep going. 

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The element tab is what allows us to see the breakdown of html and css documents. This is really helpful from a developer point of view because we can go in and change certian properties within those documents and see the changes on our screen without ever actually changing the code in Vscode. This is really useful if something isn't working the way we want it to and we want to test out different solutions without having to change the code over and over again. I personally use it a lot because my brain understands problems back to front, so I like to analyze where the problems went wrong more so than where they went write. Most times in development and life looking at where things went wrong can bring about the most improvement. 

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

A better way to debug our code is to analyze our code and determine what each and every part of the code is doing. A lot of times we may have mispelled something or wrote in a variable that has no use to the function. Even if we console log it to the console, it might still work and look right. By analyzing what went wrong in the document itself we are able to understand what each and everyone of our functions are actually doing.
