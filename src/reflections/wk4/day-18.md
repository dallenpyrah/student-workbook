1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REpresntational State Transfer, it means that the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state for the requested source. For example the server will request a resource and it will bring back all the data for a user on instagram and display their name, bio, and all their photos. 

2. What does Stateless mean?

It means that the server doesnt remember any of the requests that we made previously or anything about the user who is using the api. The only thing that its concerned with is the current request that we are making. Each request contains everything we need from the server then it moves onto the next thing. 

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

The URL pattern that we follow when we are making a RESTful api is we first get them by the client, which is the person or software that is using the specific API. The second thing we need for our pattern is the resource, a resource is any object that the client can provide information about. Every resource has a unique identifier.
